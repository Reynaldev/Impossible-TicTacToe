A simple TicTacToe game from my [previous TicTacToe game](https://github.com/Reynaldev/TicTaC) but with GUI (I used SFML to create it).

## How to play
- `LMB` put a symbol
- `R` reset the cells

## Compiling the Source Code
### Visual Studio
This project is using the 32-bit of SFML library. So you may need to set the platform to Win32. This project also tested on Visual Studio 2022
